### Description:

Many platforms, such as Netflix, Youtube, and Facebook used recommendation systems to improve the quality of search results and suggests items that are relevant 
to the search item or are realted to the user's search history. Based on the dataset of Cigarette Ratings by Smokers, the two recommendation systems which are
Content-based filtering and Collaborative filtering are created using matrix factorization and NMF techniques. 
The functions are then created to return the recommended cigarette products refer to each system.

**Dataset:** [Cigarette Ratings by Smokers](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mikhailverghese/cigarette-reviews-by-smokers)

### Project Summary:

* **Content-based Filtering** - This system suggest the cigarette that are close to the certain characteristics, which are 'Rating', 'Strength', 'Taste', 'Price' and 'Type'. Also, only cigarettes that rated by at least 10 people are selected to ensure good cigarette recommendation to customer and use caption like "More than 10 people choose this product" or "Other cigarettes you may enjoy!"

* **Collaborative Filtering** - As content-based filtering has limitation in suggesting diverse cigarettes, collaborative filtering allows business to capture more on customers' taste and suggest cigarettes that certain user may not have try before with some caption like "People who bought this item also bought..."
