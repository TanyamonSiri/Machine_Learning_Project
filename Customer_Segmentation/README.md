### Description:

As customer segmentation is vital for business to create presonalized experiences and more engagement with customers. Based on the dataset of Mall Customer, K-means Clustering model was built using `PyCaret` library in order to segmenting the customer data from their characteristics such as Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score. The elbow method is also used to find the suitable `k` or number of cluster.

**Dataset:** [Mall Customer Segmentation Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)

K-means algorithms generated the following 5 clusters

* Cluster 0: Clients with **low** annual income and **low** spending score
* Cluster 1: Clients with **medium** annual income and **medium** spending score
* Cluster 2: Clients with **high** annual income and **high** spending score
* Cluster 3: Clients with **high** annual income and **low** spending score
* Cluster 4: Clients with **low** annual income and **high** spending score

Note that in terms of age, there're no distinct group except for Cluster 4 which contains the youngest group of clients refer to theirs average age
