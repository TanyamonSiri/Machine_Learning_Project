# Machine_Learning_Project
All projects and coursework using python to solve real business problems such as customer segmentation, recommendation system, churn prediction, etc learnt from the Data Master Bootcamp by Xlab Digital. See my final project [here](https://github.com/TanyamonSiri/house-prices-prediction-with-regression-model).

## Customer Segmentation 

Perform a [mall customer segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python) using unsupervised machine learning algorithm, K-means Clustering. The `PyCaret` library is used to create the model, evaluate and plot relevant visualizations.

## Recommendation System
Create cigarette recommendation system to smokers based on [Cigarette Rating by Smokers dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mikhailverghese/cigarette-reviews-by-smokers), including content-based filtering and collaborative filtering using matrix factorization and NMF.
